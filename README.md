## Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze the phenomenon of mobile addiction among engineering students. With the increasing reliance on mobile devices for communication, entertainment, and academic purposes, understanding the extent of mobile addiction and its impact on students' academic performance and mental health is crucial.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to identify the factors contributing to mobile addiction among engineering students and to assess its implications on their academic performance and overall well-being. We aim to answer the following questions:
- What is the prevalence of mobile addiction among engineering students?
- What factors contribute to mobile addiction in this demographic?
- How does mobile addiction affect academic performance and mental health?

## Objectives
- To analyze survey data collected from engineering students regarding their mobile usage patterns.
- To identify key factors associated with mobile addiction.
- To provide insights and recommendations for mitigating mobile addiction among students.

## Data Collection
Data for this project was collected from a CSV file available on the web. The dataset includes responses from engineering students and contains information on:
- Daily mobile usage time
- Types of mobile applications used
- Academic performance indicators
- Self-reported levels of mobile addiction

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing visualizations and statistical methods to explore the data and identify patterns.
3. **Modeling**: Applying machine learning techniques to classify students based on their mobile usage patterns and predict the likelihood of mobile addiction.
4. **Interpretation**: Analyzing the results to draw meaningful conclusions and recommendations.

## Results
The results of the analysis will be documented in detail, including visualizations and statistical findings. Key insights will be highlighted to provide a comprehensive understanding of mobile addiction among engineering students.
